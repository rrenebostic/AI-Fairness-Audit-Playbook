# AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook
This cohesive Fairness Audit Playbook systematically evaluates AI systems for bias and fairness issues.

## Overview ##

This playbook integrates four core components into a cohesive workflow that enables engineering teams to systematically audit AI systems for fairness. The components are: (1) Historical Context Assessment, (2) Fairness Definition Selection, (3) Bias Source Identification, and (4) Fairness Metrics.

## Contents ##

[**Executive Summary**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/01-executive-summary.md)

[**Chapter 1: Implementation Guide**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/02-implementation-guide.md)

Practical guidance on using the playbook, including key decision points, supporting evidence, and risk identification.

[**Chapter 2: Employment Screening Case Study**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/03-case-study.md))

Demonstration of the playbook's application to a real-world fairness problem, showing the framework in action.

[**Chapter 3: Component Integration Workflow**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/04-component-integration.md)

Integration of all four fairness components with clear workflows showing how outputs from each component feed into subsequent ones.

[**Chapter 4: Validation Framework**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/05-validation-framework.md)

Guidance for implementation teams to verify the effectiveness of their audit process and ensure desired outcomes.

[**Chapter 5: Intersectional Fairness**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/06-intersectional-fairness.md)

Explicit consideration of intersectional fairness across multiple protected attributes in each component of the playbook.

[**Chapter 6: Domain Adaptability**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/07-domain-adaptability.md)

Guidelines for adapting the playbook across different domains (healthcare, finance, etc.) and problem types (classification, regression, etc.).

[**Chapter 7: Organizational Implementation**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/08-organizational-implementation.md)

Practical considerations for organizational adoption, including time requirements, necessary expertise, and integration with existing development processes.

[**Chapter 8: Insights for Improvement**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/09-insights-for-improvement.md)

Insights on continuous improvement and how the playbook can be enhanced over time.

[**Chapter 9: The Business Case for an AI Fairness Audit**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/10-business-case.md)

The Business Case provides the justification for the AI Fairness Audit with the accompanying Return on Investment (ROI) to present financial evidence that it is a worthwhile investment.


## Getting Started ##

1. Begin with the **Executive Summary** to provide a concise, high-level overview of the entire document, allowing busy stakeholders to quickly understand the key information and recommendations.
  
2. Review the **Implementation Guide** to understand how to use the playbook.

3. Examine the **Case Study** that demonstrates the application of the playbook to a typical Employment Screening fairness problem.
  
4. Study the **Component Integration Workflow** to understand how outputs from each component feed into subsequent ones.
   
5. **Adapt the framework as a roadmap to transform AI fairness** from a purely technical exercise into a sociotechnical practice that addresses domain specific inequities.
