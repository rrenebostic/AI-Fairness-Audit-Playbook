# AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook
This cohesive Fairness Audit Playbook systematically evaluates AI systems for bias and fairness issues. 

## Overview ##

This playbook integrates four core componentsnto a cohesive workflow that enables engineering teams to systematically audit AI systems for fairness. The components are: (1) Historical Context Assessment, (2) Fairness Definition Selection, (3) Bias Source Identification, and (4) Fairness Metrics.

## Contents ##

[**01. Component Integration**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/01-component-integration.md)

Integration of all four fairness components with clear workflows showing how outputs from each component feed into subsequent ones.

[**02. Implementation Guide**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/02-implementation-guide.md)

Practical guidance on using the playbook, including key decision points, supporting evidence, and risk identification.

[**03. Case Study**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/03-case-study.md)

Demonstration of the playbook's application to a real-world fairness problem, showing the framework in action.

[**04. Validation Framework**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/04-validation-framework.md)

Guidance for implementation teams to verify the effectiveness of their audit process and ensure desired outcomes.

[**05. Intersectional Fairness**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/05-intersectional-fairness.md)

Explicit consideration of intersectional fairness across multiple protected attributes in each component of the playbook.

[**06. Domain Adaptability**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/06-domain-adaptability.md)

Guidelines for adapting the playbook across different domains (healthcare, finance, etc.) and problem types (classification, regression, etc.).

[**07. Organizational Implementation**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/blob/main/07-organizational-implementation.md)

Practical considerations for organizational adoption, including time requirements, necessary expertise, and integration with existing development processes.

[**08. Insights for Improvement**](https://github.com/rrenebostic/AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook/tree/main)

Insights on continuous improvement and how the playbook can be enhanced over time.
