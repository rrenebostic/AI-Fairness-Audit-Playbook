# AI-Fairness-Audit-Playbook
This cohesive Fairness Audit Playbook systematically evaluates AI systems for bias and fairness issues. 

## Overview ##

This playbook integrates four core components—Historical Context Assessment, Fairness Definition Selection, Bias Source Identification, and Comprehensive Metrics—into a cohesive workflow that enables engineering teams to systematically audit AI systems for fairness.

## Contents ##

**01. Component Integration**

Integration of all four fairness components with clear workflows showing how outputs from each component feed into subsequent ones.

**02. Implementation Guide**

Practical guidance on using the playbook, including key decision points, supporting evidence, and risk identification.

**03. Case Study**

Demonstration of the playbook's application to a real-world fairness problem, showing the framework in action.

**04. Validation Framework**

Guidance for implementation teams to verify the effectiveness of their audit process and ensure desired outcomes.

**05. Intersectional Fairness**

Explicit consideration of intersectional fairness across multiple protected attributes in each component of the playbook.

**06. Domain Adaptability**

Guidelines for adapting the playbook across different domains (healthcare, finance, etc.) and problem types (classification, regression, etc.).

**07. Organizational Implementation**

Practical considerations for organizational adoption, including time requirements, necessary expertise, and integration with existing development processes.

**08. Insights for Improvement**

Insights on continuous improvement and how the playbook can be enhanced over time.
