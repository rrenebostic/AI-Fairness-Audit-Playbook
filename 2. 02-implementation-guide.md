# AI Fairness Audit: Implementation Guide

## Introduction ##

The AI Fairness Audit Playbook provides a systematic framework for evaluating AI systems for bias and fairness issues. This standardized approach integrates four interconnected components to ensure comprehensive fairness assessment across engineering teams. The playbook transforms theoretical fairness concepts into actionable workflows that preserve methodological rigor while accommodating domain-specific requirements.

## Key Decision Points ##

**TBD**

## Supporting Evidence ##

The playbook addresses documented patterns where AI systems perpetuate historical discrimination, such as hiring algorithms reinforcing gender bias and credit scoring models creating ethnic disparities. Statistical validation through bootstrap confidence intervals and intersectional fairness assessment ensures robust evaluation across demographic intersections.

## Identified Risks ##

•	**Regulatory Compliance:** Navigate uncertainty by implementing conservative approaches that satisfy strict interpretations.
 
•	**Resource Requirements:** Ensure adequate legal expertise and cross-functional collaboration.

 
•	**Technical Translation:** Bridge gaps between legal frameworks and technical implementation through concrete thresholds and verification checklists.
